His goal was to promote the growth of tobacco. In 1928, two warehouses were built on South College Street. The tobacco warehouse sales grew rapidly each year making history. Although there are different times and cultures between the Tobacco plant and West District. One has already created so much culture and history and now West District plans to do the same. Today, that history and architecture is being revitalized to become a new work, live, and play development. Our hopes are to keep the history alive when you experience West."
